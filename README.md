Yeah, I have only some idea of what I'm doing...


var user = prompt("Do you like turtles? YES or NO").toUpperCase();

switch(user) {
    case 'YES':
        console.log("I do too!!!");
        break;
    case 'NO':
        console.log("How can you not?!?");
        break;
    case "Maybe":
        console.log("That wasn't even one of the choices man.")
        break;
    default:
        console.log("That is creative...") 
}
